1
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,247
PASTOR: We're gathered
here in the sight of God

2
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,741
and in the presence of this company

3
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:51,883
to join together this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

4
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,720
If anyone can show just cause
why the two of them

5
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,101
should not be lawfully wed, let them speak
now or forever hold their peace.

6
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:05,873
Anyone?

7
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,012
Anyone?

8
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:08,827
Well, this is awkward.

9
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,729
I wasn't sure we'd get past this.

10
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:11,917
All right, go ahead and have a seat.

11
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:33,377
I want to read you some scriptures today.

12
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,569
No, not the traditional scriptures

13
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,338
I'm reading from Colossians
three, verses 12 and 17.

14
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,987
In the NIV version.

15
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,583
Therefore, as God's chosen

16
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:49,167
people, holy and dearly loved,
clothe yourselves with compassion,

17
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:53,581
kindness and humility,
gentleness and patience.

18
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,807
Bear with each other
and forgive one another

19
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,829
if any of you has a grievance
against someone,

20
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,157
forgive as the Lord forgave you,

21
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,503
and over all these virtues put on love,
which binds them together

22
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:09,405
in perfect unity.

23
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,325
Let the peace of Christ
rule in your hearts,

24
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:15,347
since as members of one body
you were called to peace

25
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:19,048
and be thankful.

26
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:23,089
Let the message of Christ dwell among you
richly as you teach and admonish one

27
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,944
another with all your wisdom through
psalms, hymns, and songs from the spirit.

28
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,815
Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts.

29
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:35,415
And whatever you do,
whether in word or deed, do it

30
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:39,625
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
thanks of God the Father

31
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,987
through him.

32
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,450
Now, while dating,
you may have spent a lot of time

33
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,438
thinking about how you will dress
on this very day.

34
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:52,427
On your wedding day.

35
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:55,381
You may have thought what you need to wear
every single day,

36
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:58,369
like when you go to work
or when you're going out.

37
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:00,949
But did you think about how

38
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,972
you would dress throughout your marriage?

39
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,281
These verses
talk about how you need to dress

40
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:09,269
to respond each day in your relationship.

41
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,460
Verse
12 says, clothe yourself with compassion,

42
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:16,060
kindness, humility, gentleness and peace.

43
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,934
It doesn't take effort or intentionality

44
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,160
to be self-focused,
unforgiving, or impatient.

45
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:28,827
That comes naturally,
but it takes an active choice.

46
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:33,343
Time in the Bible, prayer, praise,
and thankfulness

47
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:36,501
to God to be able to put on kindness

48
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:40,848
when it's hard to put on humility
when you think you're right,

49
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:45,839
or dress with forgiveness
as generously as Jesus did,

50
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:50,083
and in everything do it is under the Lord.

51
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,207
Work, home,  professionally,

52
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:56,229
socially, all things as under the Lord.

53
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,508
Now, David
and Katrina have written their own vows.

54
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,296
And I'm going to hand this mic to...

55
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,318
it looks like Katrina first.

56
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:24,447
KATRINA: My dearest, David,

57
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,435
I love you so incredibly much.

58
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,645
From the first moment I heard your bright
laughter and witnessed your sweet smile.

59
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,347
I just knew you were someone special.

60
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,029
All it took was one video call
two years ago.

61
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,051
To make me fall in love with who you are.

62
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,021
Since the day we've met,
you've always held

63
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,009
a special place in my heart and mind.

64
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:47,978
At last we’re here in our wedding day.

65
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,268
And I'm so happy

66
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,257
to be marrying my loving cherished soul mate.

67
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,909
As your wife,

68
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:59,897
I vow to always be by your side in both
the good times and bad.

69
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:03,835
I promise to hold and comfort
you whenever you're sad and jump around

70
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,786
with you when you're happy.

71
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:09,336
I promise to care for you when you're sick
and be a source of encouragement

72
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,543
when life gets hard.

73
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,615
I promise to hold your heart tenderly,

74
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:16,637
being gentle and caring to you always.

75
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,659
Pray that we seek God

76
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,375
and always keep him
centered in our relationship

77
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,397
so that we can
not only keep strong faith for ourselves,

78
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:28,386
but also raise children together
who love and follow Jesus.

79
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,985
To my soulmate, best friend
and now my husband.

80
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,071
I love you, David.

81
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:36,060
Always, and forever.

82
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,947
DAVID: Katrina,

83
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:53,003
I've always had an image in my mind

84
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,195
of what the girl of my dreams would be.

85
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:59,897
I knew that she would be someone kind,

86
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:02,477
someone beautiful,

87
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:05,499
someone funny, unique and sweet.

88
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,846
The girl of my dreams
would bring endless joy to my life.

89
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,037
Even when things were difficult.

90
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,399
She would be someone that I
knew I could always trust and rely on.

91
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,983
Someone
that wouldn't just make life easier,

92
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:24,345
but make it a pleasure to live.

93
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:30,830
I'm so grateful
that God brought us together, because

94
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,667
when I met you,
I realized that you are better

95
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:38,131
than anything I ever could’ve dreamed of.

96
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:43,156
As your husband, I promise
I'll do my best to provide for you.

97
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,027
I promise to keep laughing with you,
to cry

98
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:50,049
with you, to support and protect you.

99
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:54,226
As your husband, I promise to be patient,

100
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,927
and kind, and understanding.

101
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:00,304
I promise to pray with you,

102
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,530
to walk side by side with you, and...

103
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:06,755
and that

104
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:11,373
in 50 years, I'll still hold your hands,
cherish your smile

105
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:15,278
and look into your eyes the exact same way

106
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,927
I'm looking at you right now.

107
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,489
As your husband,

108
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,356
I promise to love you for eternity.

109
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,959
PASTOR: Might as well hang on to that.

110
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,283
(audience giggles)

111
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,932
PASTOR: I gotta follow that!

112
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:33,920
David, do you take Katrina,

113
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,248
this woman,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

114
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:42,341
to love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

115
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:47,061
in sorrow and in joy to have
and to hold from this day forward

116
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,238
for richer, for poorer,
as long as you both shall live?

117
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,939
DAVID: I do.

118
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,112
PASTOR: Your turn...

119
00:12:57,112 --> 00:13:00,372
Do you, Katrina, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband,

120
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:03,903
to love him, comfort him, honor and 

121
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:08,419
keep him in sickness,   
and in health, in sorrow, and in joy

122
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,509
to have and to hold from this day

123
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:14,531
forward, for richer, for poorer

124
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,976
as long as you both shall live?

125
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,998
KATRINA: I do.

126
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:30,626
PASTOR: Okay. *Whew*

127
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:35,584
And we have rings?

128
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:41,356
David, take this ring and repeat after me:

129
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,443
With this ring... 

130
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:43,258
DAVID: With this ring... 

131
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,378
PASTOR: I thee wed.

132
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:45,295
DAVID: I thee wed.

133
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,095
PASTOR: And I
give you this ring...

134
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,419
DAVID: I give you this ring...

135
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,762
PASTOR: As a reminder that I will love...

136
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:52,086
DAVID: As a reminder that I will love...  

137
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,784
PASTOR: Honor and cherish you...

138
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,380
DAVID: Honor and cherish you...

139
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,519
PASTOR: in all times, in all places...

140
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,659
DAVID: in all times, in all places...

141
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:01,560
PASTOR: And all ways, forever.

142
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,394
DAVID: And all ways, forever.

143
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:04,480
PASTOR: (whispering) Put it on her finger...

144
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,333
PASTOR: I give you this
ring as a symbol of my love...

145
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,966
DAVID: I give you this ring as a symbol of my love...

146
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,222
PASTOR: And all that I am...

147
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,614
DAVID: And all that I am...

148
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:14,463
PASTOR: And all that I have.

149
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:15,855
DAVID: And all that I have.

150
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:23,394
PASTOR: Katrina, take this ring and repeat after me:

151
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,024
With this ring...

152
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:25,940
KATRINA: With this ring...

153
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,857
PASTOR: I thee wed.

154
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:27,434
KATRINA: I thee wed.

155
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,302
PASTOR: I give you this ring as a reminder...

156
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,864
KATRINA: I give you this ring as a reminder...

157
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:33,750
PASTOR: that I will love, honor and cherish you.

158
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,025
KATRINA: that I will love, honor and cherish you.

159
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,232
PASTOR: In all times, in all places...

160
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,930
KATRINA: In all times, in all places...

161

00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,136

169
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:52,324

170
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,735

171
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,112
PASTOR: Insomuch as

172
00:14:57,112 --> 00:15:01,051
David and Katrina have consented together
in holy wedlock, and witnessed

173
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:05,770
the same before God, and in this company
have giving and pledged their faith each

174
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,015
to the other, having declared the same
by the giving and receiving of rings.

175
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:13,241
I pronounce that you are husband and wife,

176
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,500
those whom God has joined together
let no man put asunder.

177
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,489
Let us pray.

178
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,424
Heavenly Father, how appropriate

179
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:24,786
is to call you Father.
As you look down on your children,

180
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:25,635
what a joy

181
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:29,709
when we get to please You
and do as You desire.  And how disappointed

182
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,682
You can be when we fail
and we do fail, yet You still love us.

183
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,380
Today is no different.

184
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,757
These two are so perfectly paired.

185
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,779
I pray, Father,
that You bless them together as a family.

186
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,005
You cause them to grow together
and with You.

187
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,638
Let the path that they travel
as a family together.

188
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:50,592
Bless this house from this day forward.

189
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:53,071
In Your name we pray, Amen.

190
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:53,682
AUDIENCE: Amen.

191
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,670
