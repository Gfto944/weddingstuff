05:42.885 --> 05:46.247 PASTOR: We're gathered here in the sight of God line:85% position:50% align:center
05:46.247 --> 05:47.741 and in the presence of this company line:85% position:50% align:center
05:47.741 --> 05:51.883 to join together this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. line:85% position:50% align:center
05:52.834 --> 05:55.720 If anyone can show just cause why the two of them line:85% position:50% align:center
05:55.720 --> 06:00.101 should not be lawfully wed, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:04.413 --> 06:05.873 Anyone? line:85% position:50% align:center
06:05.873 --> 06:08.012 Anyone? line:85% position:50% align:center
06:08.012 --> 06:08.827 Well, this is awkward. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:08.827 --> 06:10.729 I wasn't sure we'd get past this. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:10.729 --> 06:11.917 All right, go ahead and have a seat. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:30.355 --> 06:33.377 I want to read you some scriptures today. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:33.853 --> 06:36.569 No, not the traditional scriptures line:85% position:50% align:center
06:36.569 --> 06:40.338 I'm reading from Colossians three, verses 12 and 17. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:40.338 --> 06:42.987 In the NIV version. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:42.987 --> 06:44.583 Therefore, as God's chosen line:85% position:50% align:center
06:44.583 --> 06:49.167 people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, line:85% position:50% align:center
06:49.982 --> 06:53.581 kindness and humility, gentleness and patience. line:85% position:50% align:center
06:54.430 --> 06:56.807 Bear with each other and forgive one another line:85% position:50% align:center
06:56.807 --> 06:59.829 if any of you has a grievance against someone, line:85% position:50% align:center
07:00.169 --> 07:03.157 forgive as the Lord forgave you, line:85% position:50% align:center
07:03.157 --> 07:07.503 and over all these virtues put on love, which binds them together line:85% position:50% align:center
07:07.503 --> 07:09.405 in perfect unity. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:09.405 --> 07:12.325 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, line:85% position:50% align:center
07:12.325 --> 07:15.347 since as members of one body you were called to peace line:85% position:50% align:center
07:16.298 --> 07:19.048 and be thankful. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:19.048 --> 07:23.089 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one line:85% position:50% align:center
07:23.089 --> 07:27.944 another with all your wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the spirit. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:29.031 --> 07:31.815 Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:31.815 --> 07:35.415 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it line:85% position:50% align:center
07:35.415 --> 07:39.625 all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks of God the Father line:85% position:50% align:center
07:39.999 --> 07:42.987 through him. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:43.666 --> 07:46.450 Now, while dating, you may have spent a lot of time line:85% position:50% align:center
07:46.450 --> 07:49.438 thinking about how you will dress on this very day. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:49.438 --> 07:52.427 On your wedding day. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:52.427 --> 07:55.381 You may have thought what you need to wear every single day, line:85% position:50% align:center
07:55.381 --> 07:58.369 like when you go to work or when you're going out. line:85% position:50% align:center
07:59.727 --> 08:00.949 But did you think about how line:85% position:50% align:center
08:00.949 --> 08:03.972 you would dress throughout your marriage? line:85% position:50% align:center
08:04.005 --> 08:06.281 These verses talk about how you need to dress line:85% position:50% align:center
08:06.281 --> 08:09.269 to respond each day in your relationship. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:09.438 --> 08:12.460 Verse 12 says, clothe yourself with compassion, line:85% position:50% align:center
08:12.664 --> 08:16.060 kindness, humility, gentleness and peace. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:19.320 --> 08:21.934 It doesn't take effort or intentionality line:85% position:50% align:center
08:21.934 --> 08:25.160 to be self-focused, unforgiving, or impatient. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:25.398 --> 08:28.827 That comes naturally, but it takes an active choice. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:29.472 --> 08:33.343 Time in the Bible, prayer, praise, and thankfulness line:85% position:50% align:center
08:33.343 --> 08:36.501 to God to be able to put on kindness line:85% position:50% align:center
08:37.248 --> 08:40.848 when it's hard to put on humility when you think you're right, line:85% position:50% align:center
08:41.595 --> 08:45.839 or dress with forgiveness as generously as Jesus did, line:85% position:50% align:center
08:47.537 --> 08:50.083 and in everything do it is under the Lord. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:50.083 --> 08:53.207 Work, home,  professionally, line:85% position:50% align:center
08:53.207 --> 08:56.229 socially, all things as under the Lord. line:85% position:50% align:center
08:57.520 --> 09:00.508 Now, David and Katrina have written their own vows. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:02.715 --> 09:05.296 And I'm going to hand this mic to... line:85% position:50% align:center
09:05.296 --> 09:08.318 it looks like Katrina first. line:85% position:50% align:center

09:32.358 --> 09:35.347 I just knew you were someone special. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:35.686 --> 09:38.029 All it took was one video call two years ago. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:38.029 --> 09:41.051 To make me fall in love with who you are. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:41.425 --> 09:43.021 Since the day we've met, you've always held line:85% position:50% align:center
09:43.021 --> 09:46.009 a special place in my heart and mind. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:46.246 --> 09:47.978 At last we’re here in our wedding day. line:85% position:50% align:center
09:47.978 --> 09:49.268 And I'm so happy line:85% position:50% align:center
09:49.268 --> 09:52.257 to be marrying my loving cherished soul mate. line:85% position:50% align:center

09:56.909 --> 09:59.897 I vow to always be by your side in both the good times and bad. line:85% position:50% align:center
10:00.542 --> 10:03.835 I promise to hold and comfort you whenever you're sad and jump around line:85% position:50% align:center
10:03.835 --> 10:04.786 with you when you're happy. line:85% position:50% align:center
10:06.212 --> 10:09.336 I promise to care for you when you're sick and be a source of encouragement line:85% position:50% align:center
10:09.336 --> 10:11.543 when life gets hard. line:85% position:50% align:center
10:11.543 --> 10:13.615 I promise to hold your heart tenderly, line:85% position:50% align:center
10:13.615 --> 10:16.637 being gentle and caring to you always. line:85% position:50% align:center
10:18.199 --> 10:19.659 Pray that we seek God line:85% position:50% align:center
10:19.659 --> 10:22.375 and always keep him centered in our relationship line:85% position:50% align:center
10:22.375 --> 10:25.397 so that we can not only keep strong faith for ourselves, line:85% position:50% align:center
10:25.397 --> 10:28.386 but also raise children together who love and follow Jesus. line:85% position:50% align:center
