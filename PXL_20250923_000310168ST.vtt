WEBVTT

05:42.885 --> 05:46.247
PASTOR: We're gathered
here in the sight of God

05:46.247 --> 05:47.741
and in the presence of this company

05:47.741 --> 05:51.883
to join together this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.720
If anyone can show just cause
why the two of them

05:55.720 --> 06:00.101
should not be lawfully wed, let them speak
now or forever hold their peace.

06:04.413 --> 06:05.873
Anyone?

06:05.873 --> 06:08.012
Anyone?

06:08.012 --> 06:08.827
Well, this is awkward.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.729
I wasn't sure we'd get past this.

06:10.729 --> 06:11.917
All right, go ahead and have a seat.

06:30.355 --> 06:33.377
I want to read you some scriptures today.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.569
No, not the traditional scriptures

06:36.569 --> 06:40.338
I'm reading from Colossians
three, verses 12 and 17.

06:40.338 --> 06:42.987
In the NIV version.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.583
Therefore, as God's chosen

06:44.583 --> 06:49.167
people, holy and dearly loved,
clothe yourselves with compassion,

06:49.982 --> 06:53.581
kindness and humility,
gentleness and patience.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.807
Bear with each other
and forgive one another

06:56.807 --> 06:59.829
if any of you has a grievance
against someone,

07:00.169 --> 07:03.157
forgive as the Lord forgave you,

07:03.157 --> 07:07.503
and over all these virtues put on love,
which binds them together

07:07.503 --> 07:09.405
in perfect unity.

07:09.405 --> 07:12.325
Let the peace of Christ
rule in your hearts,

07:12.325 --> 07:15.347
since as members of one body
you were called to peace

07:16.298 --> 07:19.048
and be thankful.

07:19.048 --> 07:23.089
Let the message of Christ dwell among you
richly as you teach and admonish one

07:23.089 --> 07:27.944
another with all your wisdom through
psalms, hymns, and songs from the spirit.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.815
Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts.

07:31.815 --> 07:35.415
And whatever you do,
whether in word or deed, do it

07:35.415 --> 07:39.625
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
thanks of God the Father

07:39.999 --> 07:42.987
through him.

07:43.666 --> 07:46.450
Now, while dating,
you may have spent a lot of time

07:46.450 --> 07:49.438
thinking about how you will dress
on this very day.

07:49.438 --> 07:52.427
On your wedding day.

07:52.427 --> 07:55.381
You may have thought what you need to wear
every single day,

07:55.381 --> 07:58.369
like when you go to work
or when you're going out.

07:59.727 --> 08:00.949
But did you think about how

08:00.949 --> 08:03.972
you would dress throughout your marriage?

08:04.005 --> 08:06.281
These verses
talk about how you need to dress

08:06.281 --> 08:09.269
to respond each day in your relationship.

08:09.438 --> 08:12.460
Verse
12 says, clothe yourself with compassion,

08:12.664 --> 08:16.060
kindness, humility, gentleness and peace.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.934
It doesn't take effort or intentionality

08:21.934 --> 08:25.160
to be self-focused,
unforgiving, or impatient.

08:25.398 --> 08:28.827
That comes naturally,
but it takes an active choice.

08:29.472 --> 08:33.343
Time in the Bible, prayer, praise,
and thankfulness

08:33.343 --> 08:36.501
to God to be able to put on kindness

08:37.248 --> 08:40.848
when it's hard to put on humility
when you think you're right,

08:41.595 --> 08:45.839
or dress with forgiveness
as generously as Jesus did,

08:47.537 --> 08:50.083
and in everything do it is under the Lord.

08:50.083 --> 08:53.207
Work, home,  professionally,

08:53.207 --> 08:56.229
socially, all things as under the Lord.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.508
Now, David
and Katrina have written their own vows.

09:02.715 --> 09:05.296
And I'm going to hand this mic to...

09:05.296 --> 09:08.318
it looks like Katrina first.

09:21.798 --> 09:24.447
KATRINA: My dearest, David,

09:24.447 --> 09:27.435
I love you so incredibly much.

09:27.910 --> 09:31.645
From the first moment I heard your bright
laughter and witnessed your sweet smile.

09:32.358 --> 09:35.347
I just knew you were someone special.

09:35.686 --> 09:38.029
All it took was one video call
two years ago.

09:38.029 --> 09:41.051
To make me fall in love with who you are.

09:41.425 --> 09:43.021
Since the day we've met,
you've always held

09:43.021 --> 09:46.009
a special place in my heart and mind.

09:46.246 --> 09:47.978
At last we’re here in our wedding day.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.268
And I'm so happy

09:49.268 --> 09:52.257
to be marrying my loving cherished soul mate.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.909
As your wife,

09:56.909 --> 09:59.897
I vow to always be by your side in both
the good times and bad.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.835
I promise to hold and comfort
you whenever you're sad and jump around

10:03.835 --> 10:04.786
with you when you're happy.

10:06.212 --> 10:09.336
I promise to care for you when you're sick
and be a source of encouragement

10:09.336 --> 10:11.543
when life gets hard.

10:11.543 --> 10:13.615
I promise to hold your heart tenderly,

10:13.615 --> 10:16.637
being gentle and caring to you always.

10:18.199 --> 10:19.659
Pray that we seek God

10:19.659 --> 10:22.375
and always keep him
centered in our relationship

10:22.375 --> 10:25.397
so that we can
not only keep strong faith for ourselves,

10:25.397 --> 10:28.386
but also raise children together
who love and follow Jesus.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.985
To my soulmate, best friend
and now my husband.

10:31.985 --> 10:33.071
I love you, David.

10:33.071 --> 10:36.060
Always, and forever.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.947
DAVID: Katrina,

10:49.981 --> 10:53.003
I've always had an image in my mind

10:53.207 --> 10:56.195
of what the girl of my dreams would be.

10:57.112 --> 10:59.897
I knew that she would be someone kind,

10:59.897 --> 11:02.477
someone beautiful,

11:02.477 --> 11:05.499
someone funny, unique and sweet.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.846
The girl of my dreams
would bring endless joy to my life.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.037
Even when things were difficult.

11:13.037 --> 11:16.399
She would be someone that I
knew I could always trust and rely on.

11:17.961 --> 11:20.983
Someone
that wouldn't just make life easier,

11:21.323 --> 11:24.345
but make it a pleasure to live.

11:26.925 --> 11:30.830
I'm so grateful
that God brought us together, because

11:30.830 --> 11:34.667
when I met you,
I realized that you are better

11:35.143 --> 11:38.131
than anything I ever could’ve dreamed of.

11:39.048 --> 11:43.156
As your husband, I promise
I'll do my best to provide for you.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.027
I promise to keep laughing with you,
to cry

11:47.027 --> 11:50.049
with you, to support and protect you.

11:51.204 --> 11:54.226
As your husband, I promise to be patient,

11:54.939 --> 11:57.927
and kind, and understanding.

11:58.097 --> 12:00.304
I promise to pray with you,

12:00.304 --> 12:03.530
to walk side by side with you, and...

12:06.348 --> 12:06.755
and that

12:06.755 --> 12:11.373
in 50 years, I'll still hold your hands,
cherish your smile

12:12.256 --> 12:15.278
and look into your eyes the exact same way

12:15.380 --> 12:17.927
I'm looking at you right now.

12:17.927 --> 12:19.489
As your husband,

12:19.489 --> 12:21.356
I promise to love you for eternity.

12:25.227 --> 12:26.959
PASTOR: Might as well hang on to that.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.283
(audience giggles)

12:28.283 --> 12:30.932
PASTOR: I gotta follow that!

12:30.932 --> 12:33.920
David, do you take Katrina,

12:35.007 --> 12:37.248
this woman,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

12:37.248 --> 12:42.341
to love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

12:42.918 --> 12:47.061
in sorrow and in joy to have
and to hold from this day forward

12:47.265 --> 12:51.238
for richer, for poorer,
as long as you both shall live?

12:52.222 --> 12:54.939
DAVID: I do.

12:54.939 --> 12:57.112
PASTOR: Your turn...

12:57.112 --> 13:00.372
Do you, Katrina, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband,

13:01.017 --> 13:03.903
to love him, comfort him, honor and

13:03.903 --> 13:08.419
keep him in sickness,
and in health, in sorrow, and in joy

13:08.929 --> 13:11.509
to have and to hold from this day

13:11.509 --> 13:14.531
forward, for richer, for poorer

13:14.599 --> 13:16.976
as long as you both shall live?

13:16.976 --> 13:19.998
KATRINA: I do.

13:27.638 --> 13:30.626
PASTOR: Okay. *Whew*

13:32.596 --> 13:35.584
And we have rings?

13:38.334 --> 13:41.356
David, take this ring and repeat after me:

13:41.458 --> 13:42.443
With this ring...

13:42.545 --> 13:43.258
DAVID: With this ring...

13:43.462 --> 13:44.378
PASTOR: I thee wed.

13:44.582 --> 13:45.295
DAVID: I thee wed.

13:45.669 --> 13:47.095
PASTOR: And I
give you this ring...

13:47.265 --> 13:48.419
DAVID: I give you this ring...

13:48.589 --> 13:50.762
PASTOR: As a reminder that I will love...

13:50.762 --> 13:52.086
DAVID: As a reminder that I will love...

13:52.256 --> 13:53.784
PASTOR: Honor and cherish you...

13:53.784 --> 13:55.380
DAVID: Honor and cherish you...

13:55.380 --> 13:57.519
PASTOR: in all times, in all places...

13:57.519 --> 13:59.659
DAVID: in all times, in all places...

13:59.862 --> 14:01.560
PASTOR: And all ways, forever.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.394
DAVID: And all ways, forever.

14:03.394 --> 14:04.480
PASTOR: (whispering) Put it on her finger...

14:04.480 --> 14:07.333
PASTOR: I give you this
ring as a symbol of my love...

14:07.978 --> 14:10.966
DAVID: I give you this ring as a symbol of my love...

14:11.034 --> 14:12.222
PASTOR: And all that I am...

14:12.630 --> 14:13.614
DAVID: And all that I am...

14:13.614 --> 14:14.463
PASTOR: And all that I have.

14:14.939 --> 14:15.855
DAVID: And all that I have.

14:21.051 --> 14:23.394
PASTOR: Katrina, take this ring and repeat after me:

14:24.073 --> 14:25.024
With this ring...

14:25.024 --> 14:25.940
KATRINA: With this ring...

14:25.940 --> 14:26.857
PASTOR: I thee wed.

14:26.857 --> 14:27.434
KATRINA: I thee wed.

14:27.468 --> 14:29.302
PASTOR: I give you this ring as a reminder...

14:29.540 --> 14:30.864
KATRINA: I give you this ring as a reminder...

14:30.898 --> 14:33.750
PASTOR: that I will love, honor and cherish you.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.025
KATRINA: that I will love, honor and cherish you.

14:36.025 --> 14:38.232
PASTOR: In all times, in all places...

14:38.232 --> 14:39.930
KATRINA: In all times, in all places...

14:39.964 --> 14:41.933
PASTOR: in all ways, forever.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.224
KATRINA: in all ways, forever.

14:43.563 --> 14:44.650
PASTOR: I give you this ring...

14:44.650 --> 14:45.737
KATRINA : I give you this ring...

14:45.737 --> 14:47.265
PASTOR: as a symbol of my love.

14:47.265 --> 14:48.453
KATRINA: as a symbol of my love.

14:48.453 --> 14:49.845
PASTOR: And with all that I am...

14:49.845 --> 14:51.136
KATRINA: ...with all that I am...

14:51.136 --> 14:52.324
PASTOR: and all that I have.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.735
KATRINA: ...all that I have.

14:56.433 --> 14:57.112
PASTOR: Insomuch as

14:57.112 --> 15:01.051
David and Katrina have consented together
in holy wedlock, and witnessed

15:01.051 --> 15:05.770
the same before God, and in this company
have giving and pledged their faith each

15:05.770 --> 15:10.015
to the other, having declared the same
by the giving and receiving of rings.

15:10.558 --> 15:13.241
I pronounce that you are husband and wife,

15:13.241 --> 15:16.500
those whom God has joined together
let no man put asunder.

15:17.214 --> 15:19.489
Let us pray.

15:19.489 --> 15:21.424
Heavenly Father, how appropriate

15:21.424 --> 15:24.786
is to call you Father.
As you look down on your children,

15:24.786 --> 15:25.635
what a joy

15:25.635 --> 15:29.709
when we get to please You
and do as You desire.  And how disappointed

15:29.709 --> 15:33.682
You can be when we fail
and we do fail, yet You still love us.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.380
Today is no different.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.757
These two are so perfectly paired.

15:37.757 --> 15:40.779
I pray, Father,
that You bless them together as a family.

15:41.017 --> 15:44.005
You cause them to grow together
and with You.

15:44.650 --> 15:47.638
Let the path that they travel
as a family together.

15:47.706 --> 15:50.592
Bless this house from this day forward.

15:50.592 --> 15:53.071
In Your name we pray, Amen.

15:53.071 --> 15:53.682
AUDIENCE: Amen.

15:53.682 --> 15:56.670
PASTOR: You may kiss your bride!

15:56.670 --> 16:00.915
(audience cheers + applause)

16:00.915 --> 16:03.733
PASTOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my privilege to introduce to you:

16:03.733 --> 16:06.178
Mr. and Mrs. West!

16:06.178 --> 16:11.475
(audience cheers + applause)

17:51.746 --> 17:53.546
ANNCR: Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to join us

17:54.123 --> 17:56.976
on the back patio
for an open bar and appetizers...
