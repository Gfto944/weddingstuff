00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:46.247 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: We're gathered here in the
sight of God

2
00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:47.741 line:85% position:50% align:center
and in the presence of this company

3
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.883 line:85% position:50% align:center
to join together this man and this
woman in the bonds of holy
matrimony.

4
00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:55.720 line:85% position:50% align:center
If anyone can show just cause why
the two of them

5
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.101 line:85% position:50% align:center
should not be lawfully wed, let
them speak now or forever hold
their peace.

6
00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:05.873 line:85% position:50% align:center
Anyone?

7
00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:08.012 line:85% position:50% align:center
Anyone?

8
00:06:08.012 --> 00:06:08.827 line:85% position:50% align:center
Well, this is awkward.

9
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.729 line:85% position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure we'd get past this.

10
00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:11.917 line:85% position:50% align:center
All right, go ahead and have a
seat.

11
00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:33.377 line:85% position:50% align:center
I want to read you some scriptures
today.

12
00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.569 line:85% position:50% align:center
No, not the traditional scriptures

13
00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.338 line:85% position:50% align:center
I'm reading from Colossians three,
verses 12 and 17.

14
00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:42.987 line:85% position:50% align:center
In the NIV version.

15
00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:44.583 line:85% position:50% align:center
Therefore, as God's chosen

16
00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:49.167 line:85% position:50% align:center
people, holy and dearly loved,
clothe yourselves with compassion,

17
00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:53.581 line:85% position:50% align:center
kindness and humility, gentleness
and patience.

18
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.807 line:85% position:50% align:center
Bear with each other and forgive
one another

19
00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:59.829 line:85% position:50% align:center
if any of you has a grievance
against someone,

20
00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.157 line:85% position:50% align:center
forgive as the Lord forgave you,

21
00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:07.503 line:85% position:50% align:center
and over all these virtues put on
love, which binds them together

22
00:07:07.503 --> 00:07:09.405 line:85% position:50% align:center
in perfect unity.

23
00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:12.325 line:85% position:50% align:center
Let the peace of Christ rule in
your hearts,

24
00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:15.347 line:85% position:50% align:center
since as members of one body you
were called to peace

25
00:07:16.298 --> 00:07:19.048 line:85% position:50% align:center
and be thankful.

26
00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:23.089 line:85% position:50% align:center
Let the message of Christ dwell
among you richly as you teach and
admonish one

27
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:27.944 line:85% position:50% align:center
another with all your wisdom
through psalms, hymns, and songs
from the spirit.

28
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.815 line:85% position:50% align:center
Sing to God with gratitude in your
hearts.

29
00:07:31.815 --> 00:07:35.415 line:85% position:50% align:center
And whatever you do, whether in
word or deed, do it

30
00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:39.625 line:85% position:50% align:center
all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks of God the Father

31
00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:42.987 line:85% position:50% align:center
through him.

32
00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:46.450 line:85% position:50% align:center
Now, while dating, you may have
spent a lot of time

33
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.438 line:85% position:50% align:center
thinking about how you will dress
on this very day.

34
00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:52.427 line:85% position:50% align:center
On your wedding day.

35
00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:55.381 line:85% position:50% align:center
You may have thought what you need
to wear every single day,

36
00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:58.369 line:85% position:50% align:center
like when you go to work or when
you're going out.

37
00:07:59.727 --> 00:08:00.949 line:85% position:50% align:center
But did you think about how

38
00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:03.972 line:85% position:50% align:center
you would dress throughout your
marriage?

39
00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:06.281 line:85% position:50% align:center
These verses talk about how you
need to dress

40
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:09.269 line:85% position:50% align:center
to respond each day in your
relationship.

41
00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:12.460 line:85% position:50% align:center
Verse 12 says, clothe yourself with
compassion,

42
00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:16.060 line:85% position:50% align:center
kindness, humility, gentleness and
peace.

43
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.934 line:85% position:50% align:center
It doesn't take effort or
intentionality

44
00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:25.160 line:85% position:50% align:center
to be self-focused, unforgiving, or
impatient.

45
00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:28.827 line:85% position:50% align:center
That comes naturally, but it takes
an active choice.

46
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:33.343 line:85% position:50% align:center
Time in the Bible, prayer, praise,
and thankfulness

47
00:08:33.343 --> 00:08:36.501 line:85% position:50% align:center
to God to be able to put on
kindness

48
00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:40.848 line:85% position:50% align:center
when it's hard to put on humility
when you think you're right,

49
00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:45.839 line:85% position:50% align:center
or dress with forgiveness as
generously as Jesus did,

50
00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:50.083 line:85% position:50% align:center
and in everything do it is under
the Lord.

51
00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:53.207 line:85% position:50% align:center
Work, home,  professionally,

52
00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:56.229 line:85% position:50% align:center
socially, all things as under the
Lord.

53
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.508 line:85% position:50% align:center
Now, David and Katrina have written
their own vows.

54
00:09:02.715 --> 00:09:05.296 line:85% position:50% align:center
And I'm going to hand this mic
to...

55
00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:08.318 line:85% position:50% align:center
it looks like Katrina first.

56
00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:24.447 line:85% position:50% align:center
KATRINA: My dearest, David,

57
00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:27.435 line:85% position:50% align:center
I love you so incredibly much.

58
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.645 line:85% position:50% align:center
From the first moment I heard your
bright laughter and witnessed your
sweet smile.

59
00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:35.347 line:85% position:50% align:center
I just knew you were someone
special.

60
00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:38.029 line:85% position:50% align:center
All it took was one video call two
years ago.

61
00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:41.051 line:85% position:50% align:center
To make me fall in love with who
you are.

62
00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:43.021 line:85% position:50% align:center
Since the day we've met, you've
always held

63
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:46.009 line:85% position:50% align:center
a special place in my heart and
mind.

64
00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:47.978 line:85% position:50% align:center
At last weâ€™re here in our wedding
day.

65
00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:49.268 line:85% position:50% align:center
And I'm so happy

66
00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:52.257 line:85% position:50% align:center
to be marrying my loving cherished
soul mate.

67
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.909 line:85% position:50% align:center
As your wife,

68
00:09:56.909 --> 00:09:59.897 line:85% position:50% align:center
I vow to always be by your side in
both the good times and bad.

69
00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:03.835 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to hold and comfort you
whenever you're sad and jump around

70
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:04.786 line:85% position:50% align:center
with you when you're happy.

71
00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:09.336 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to care for you when
you're sick and be a source of
encouragement

72
00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.543 line:85% position:50% align:center
when life gets hard.

73
00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:13.615 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to hold your heart
tenderly,

74
00:10:13.615 --> 00:10:16.637 line:85% position:50% align:center
being gentle and caring to you
always.

75
00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.659 line:85% position:50% align:center
Pray that we seek God

76
00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:22.375 line:85% position:50% align:center
and always keep him centered in our
relationship

77
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:25.397 line:85% position:50% align:center
so that we can not only keep strong
faith for ourselves,

78
00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:28.386 line:85% position:50% align:center
but also raise children together
who love and follow Jesus.

79
00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:31.985 line:85% position:50% align:center
To my soulmate, best friend and now
my husband.

80
00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:33.071 line:85% position:50% align:center
I love you, David.

81
00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:36.060 line:85% position:50% align:center
Always, and forever.

82
00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:49.947 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: Katrina,

83
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:53.003 line:85% position:50% align:center
I've always had an image in my mind

84
00:10:53.207 --> 00:10:56.195 line:85% position:50% align:center
of what the girl of my dreams would
be.

85
00:10:57.112 --> 00:10:59.897 line:85% position:50% align:center
I knew that she would be someone
kind,

86
00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:02.477 line:85% position:50% align:center
someone beautiful,

87
00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:05.499 line:85% position:50% align:center
someone funny, unique and sweet.

88
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.846 line:85% position:50% align:center
The girl of my dreams would bring
endless joy to my life.

89
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.037 line:85% position:50% align:center
Even when things were difficult.

90
00:11:13.037 --> 00:11:16.399 line:85% position:50% align:center
She would be someone that I knew I
could always trust and rely on.

91
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.983 line:85% position:50% align:center
Someone that wouldn't just make
life easier,

92
00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:24.345 line:85% position:50% align:center
but make it a pleasure to live.

93
00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:30.830 line:85% position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful that God brought us
together, because

94
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.667 line:85% position:50% align:center
when I met you, I realized that you
are better

95
00:11:35.143 --> 00:11:38.131 line:85% position:50% align:center
than anything I ever couldâ€™ve
dreamed of.

96
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:43.156 line:85% position:50% align:center
As your husband, I promise I'll do
my best to provide for you.

97
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:47.027 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to keep laughing with
you, to cry

98
00:11:47.027 --> 00:11:50.049 line:85% position:50% align:center
with you, to support and protect
you.

99
00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:54.226 line:85% position:50% align:center
As your husband, I promise to be
patient,

100
00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:57.927 line:85% position:50% align:center
and kind, and understanding.

101
00:11:58.097 --> 00:12:00.304 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to pray with you,

102
00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:03.530 line:85% position:50% align:center
to walk side by side with you,
and...

103
00:12:06.348 --> 00:12:06.755 line:85% position:50% align:center
and that

104
00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:11.373 line:85% position:50% align:center
in 50 years, I'll still hold your
hands, cherish your smile

105
00:12:12.256 --> 00:12:15.278 line:85% position:50% align:center
and look into your eyes the exact
same way

106
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.927 line:85% position:50% align:center
I'm looking at you right now.

107
00:12:17.927 --> 00:12:19.489 line:85% position:50% align:center
As your husband,

108
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.356 line:85% position:50% align:center
I promise to love you for eternity.

109
00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:26.959 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: Might as well hang on to
that.

110
00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:28.283 line:85% position:50% align:center
(audience giggles)

111
00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:30.932 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: I gotta follow that!

112
00:12:30.932 --> 00:12:33.920 line:85% position:50% align:center
David, do you take Katrina,

113
00:12:35.007 --> 00:12:37.248 line:85% position:50% align:center
this woman, to be your lawfully
wedded wife,

114
00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:42.341 line:85% position:50% align:center
to love her, comfort her, honor and
keep her in sickness and in health,

115
00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:47.061 line:85% position:50% align:center
in sorrow and in joy to have and to
hold from this day forward

116
00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:51.238 line:85% position:50% align:center
for richer, for poorer, as long as
you both shall live?

117
00:12:52.222 --> 00:12:54.939 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: I do.

118
00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:57.112 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: Your turn...

119
00:12:57.112 --> 00:13:00.372 line:85% position:50% align:center
Do you, Katrina, take this man to
be your lawful wedded husband,

120
00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:03.903 line:85% position:50% align:center
to love him, comfort him, honor and

121
00:13:03.903 --> 00:13:08.419 line:85% position:50% align:center
keep him in sickness, and in
health, in sorrow, and in joy

122
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:11.509 line:85% position:50% align:center
to have and to hold from this day

123
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:14.531 line:85% position:50% align:center
forward, for richer, for poorer

124
00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:16.976 line:85% position:50% align:center
as long as you both shall live?

125
00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:19.998 line:85% position:50% align:center
KATRINA: I do.

126
00:13:27.638 --> 00:13:30.626 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: Okay. *Whew*

127
00:13:32.596 --> 00:13:35.584 line:85% position:50% align:center
And we have rings?

128
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:41.356 line:85% position:50% align:center
David, take this ring and repeat
after me:

129
00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:42.443 line:85% position:50% align:center
With this ring...

130
00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:43.258 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: With this ring...

131
00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:44.378 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: I thee wed.

132
00:13:44.582 --> 00:13:45.295 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: I thee wed.

133
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:47.095 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: And I give you this ring...

134
00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:48.419 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: I give you this ring...

135
00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:50.762 line:85% position:50% align:center
PASTOR: As a reminder that I will
love...

136
00:13:50.762 --> 00:13:52.086 line:85% position:50% align:center
DAVID: As a reminder that I will

the same before God, and in this

to the other, having declared the

178
00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:21.424 line:85% position:50% align:center
Heavenly Father, how appropriate

179
00:15:21.424 --> 00:15:24.786 line:85% position:50% align:center
is to call you Father. As you look
down on your children,

what a joy

181
00:15:25.635 --> 00:15:29.709 line:85% position:50% align:center
when we get to please You and do as
You desire.  And how disappointed

182
00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:33.682 line:85% position:50% align:center
You can be when we fail and we do
fail, yet You still love us.

185
00:15:37.757 --> 00:15:40.779 line:85% position:50% align:center

together as a family.

186
00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:44.005 line:85% position:50% align:center
You cause them to grow together and
with You.

187
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.638 line:85% position:50% align:center
Let the path that they travel as a
family together.

188
00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:50.592 line:85% position:50% align:center
Bless this house from this day
forward.
